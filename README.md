WSJF_V3
=========================

## Overview
Weighted Shortest Job First Grid This app displays a grid that shows the values
used to calculate the WSJF score, and then calculate the score. The values in
the grid are editable, but the score is not as it is calculated based on the
values. The columns are sortable, so for example if you want to sort by Score, 
just click on the "Score" column.

The Details: The app is designed to work with Portfolio Items of type "Feature",
and there is a release timebox. No other filtering is handled, but could be 
added. The WSJF score calculation is 
( Time Criticality + RR/OE Value + User/Business Value)/ Job Size
